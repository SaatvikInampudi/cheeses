    "text": "1.1 BACKGROUND\nCheese ratings are influenced by a blend of objective and subjective factors. Objective elements such as fat content, moisture levels, and production techniques provide a scientific basis for evaluation. Meanwhile, subjective elements—consumer taste, cultural preferences, and regional significance—play a crucial role in shaping perceptions. For instance, artisanal cheeses often score higher due to their unique flavors and quality, while mass-produced varieties may lack the same level of consumer appeal. Similarly, regional differences, such as the bold flavors of French cheeses versus the milder profiles of American cheeses, reveal how cultural context influences preferences.\nCheese also serves as a cornerstone of many culinary traditions and plays a pivotal role in global trade and agriculture. By analyzing these nuances, this project aims to bridge the gap between sensory characteristics and consumer behavior, offering insights into both individual preferences and market trends.",
